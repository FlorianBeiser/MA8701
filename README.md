# MA8701
---

This is the repo for three students named Florian, Helene, Yaolin who worked during 2021 for the course project2 in MA8701. 

It contains [P1](P1/) and [P2](P2/) two projects. 

`P1` is the first data analysis project for MA8701 on the MUNICH rental index dataset, which has around 2000 data samples. For the statistical modelling of this dataset, we used the following methods to fit the model. 

- [ridge](https://github.com/mettelang/MA8701V2021/blob/main/Part1/LassoandfriendsBenDunn.pdf)
- [lasso](https://github.com/mettelang/MA8701V2021/blob/main/Part1/LassoandfriendsBenDunn.pdf)
- [group lasso](https://github.com/mettelang/MA8701V2021/blob/main/Part1/LassoandfriendsBenDunn.pdf)

Since this dataset is rather small, it do not split into a training and test set. Hence, we applied bootstrapping for inference and validation. It can be seen that the group lasso is particularly suited for this problem.


`P2` is the second data analysis project for MA8701 on a data set obtained from https://github.com/metno/havvarsel-data-driven-pred, which contains weather and water temperature data. For the statistical modelling of this dataset, we used non-linear methods like
- ensembles, i.e. random forest
- neural nets.

More codes can be found in each repo.
