# MA8701
Data analysis project for MA8701 on the MUNICH rental index dataset. It has around 2000 data samples. We used the following methods to fit the model. We conclude that our dataset is
relatively small for affording a test set. So we applied bootstrapping method for inference and validation. It can be seen that lasso and group lasso seem to work properly while ridge is 
less desired. 

- [ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization)

- [group lasso](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/sparse-grlasso.pdf)
