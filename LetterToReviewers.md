# Letter to Reviewers

Dear 2NN,

thank you very much for your valuable comments!

To a large extend we have been following your suggestions. We would like to let you know:

- A justification why a split into training and test set is not affordable was included now. The variance is actually not super huge, but still to avoid effect depending on the particular split, we decide to do inference only with methods that do not require a test set.
